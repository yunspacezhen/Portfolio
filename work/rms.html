                <h4>User Research</h4>
                <p>To better understand the world of recruitment managers and the steps they had to complete throughout the recruitment journey, we conducted interviews with potential users: <b>ten managers</b> of varying experience and seniority levels. We had each interviewee map out their journey according to their own experience and share about touchpoints they used and challenges they faced.</p>

                <p>The interviews were extremely enlightening. They not only gave us a <b>primary and coherent account of the recruitment journey</b>, but also allowed us to identify many <b>severe pain points</b> throughout the process that <i>"can vomit blood one"</i>, as described by one interviewee. Many of these pain points revolved around the <b>inefficiency and tediousness</b> of current manual hardcopy processes, and the <b>lack of transparency and visibility</b> regarding the status of applications.</p>

                <p>From the interviews, we gathered a mountain of data, in the form of handwritten post-it notes.

                <p>There were a few key areas a digital solution could target, and we made <b>lo-fi mockups</b> of what the <b>key features</b> of this solution could look like, to test with potential users. We tested with the same participants from the user research sessions. </p>
                <p>With the feedback from the concept testing, we could suggest to the client <b>which features to prioritise</b> and <b>how to refine the concepts.</b> </p>

                <h4>Stakeholder Alignment</h4>
                <p>Any digital solution invariably disrupts existing processes and workflows in an organisation. The implementation of one in an organisation as large as our client's required <b>alignment from multiple departments and stakeholders.</b> </p>
                <p>With more than 10 participants from 7 departments, we presented the findings of the research in an alignment workshop. </p>

                <h4>Hi-Fi Design</h4>
                <p>After alignment from all stakeholders, we proceeded with the hi-fi designs for an <b>iPad app</b>. This process took more than a year due to the size of the project and the multiple rounds of clarifications necessary with relevant stakeholders.  </p>

                <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
                <p>When majority of the screens for key flows were completed, we conducted usability testing with <b>8 users</b> with varying years of experience and seniority levels.</p>
                <p>The app prototype was well-received by all participants.</p>

                <p>The <b>digitisation of their manual processes</b> through an iPad app would greatly <b>remove the tediousness</b> of filling in a lot of their pen and paper forms. Tasks could also be done much faster, and on-the-go, <b>speeding up the recruitment journey</b>. Digital forms also allowed a database of information to be stored that could be <b>visualised in different charts and graphs</b>, automatically updated when the data changed. </p>
                <p>The usability testing sessions also highlighted <b>a need for strong change management</b> on the ground as recruitment managers transitioned to the new processes created by a digital solution.</p>
                <p>Lastly, the session also identified a gap, the <b>lack of a summary table</b> where recruitment managers could view the status of all their prospects and new hires at a glance. This was lined up as a possible feature for the product roadmap.</p>
                <p><b>Usability issues</b> with the design and flow were picked up.</p>
                <p>After a review session with the client surfacing findings from the usability session and the <b>proposed changes</b>, the design was iterated on in preparation for development.</p>

                <h4>Impact</h4>
                <p>The extensive research done for this project was <b>very useful</b> for the client. From the client's feedback, independent research done by an entity outside of their organisation helped to <b>align stakeholders</b> along an objective account of the current state. Visual collateral produced like the illustrated journey map are constantly used as reference points within the organisation. </p>
                <p>The client also <b>continued to engage us</b> for future projects related to their digital transformation roadmap.</p>
                <p>The iPad app is currently being developed by the client's tech department and is being piloted with a small group of users.
