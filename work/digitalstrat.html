                <h4>Background - "Too many apps!"</h4>
                <p>Within our client's organisation, there were <b>more than 10 digital products</b> across the web, tablet and mobile app platforms. These products were created across different time periods in the organisation's history, and by different departments and had different product owners. Some were <b>legacy products</b> created decades ago: outdated interface, messy information architecture, and a steep learning curve, but which remained essential and indispensable to the daily business needs of its internal users. Some were <b>newer products</b>, with a narrower scope, and served very niche functions. Because of the silo-ed culture of product development in a large organisation like this one, some <b>functions were duplicated</b> across multiple products which left users confused about where to find things. Over the years, there had been non-stop complaints about <b>"too many apps", which we had also personally encountered in our other projects for the same client</b> </p>
                <p>Our client thus engaged us to develop an evidence-based strategy to reorganise its digital ecosystem so that their users could find the functions they need easily and conveniently. </p>

                <h4>Content Audit</h4>
                <p>The first thing we had to do was to do a stocktake of their digital ecosystem. This meant going through every single one of their digital products, be it online portals, mobile apps or tablet apps. We listed down every single business function we found in each of their products, at every hierarchy level. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-10">
                <p>From this list, we initially selected a total of <b>92 items</b> for our card set, with an equal representation from every product and across business units. Through our own internal pilot card sorting exercises, we also eliminated some cards due to duplication of the same function from multiple products. </p>

                <h4>Stakeholder Alignment</h4>
                <p>Before we launched into the card sort sessions with actual users, we held an alignment workshop for internal stakeholders from different business units. Through the alignment workshop, stakeholders did their <b>own card sort sessions</b> in groups and <b>discussed their thoughts on the future strategy</b> for the digital ecosystem. </p>

                <p>While this was merely an alignment exercise and the card sort results from this session were not included in the final analysis, this was an extremely useful session. For the <b>stakeholders</b>, they were able to visualise how themselves and their colleagues experienced the ecosystem, and discuss and understand any different views. For <b>us</b>, we gained a better understanding of the various functions supported by the digital ecosystem, and were able to use the session as a pilot run to better conduct our actual sessions. </p>

                <p>We held card sorting sessions with <b>16 participants across 3 user groups</b>.  These were <b>open card sort</b> sessions: participants were first asked to group cards according to their own association, and then they were instructed to give each group a name. </p>

                <p>On top of the card sort groups, we also had participants <b>"tag" each group</b> using categories we had defined, e.g. importance, frequency of use, place of use, platform, etc. </p>

                <p><b>Affinity mapping</b> of group names helped us see where the commonalities lay in how users naturally categorised the functions. This would help us come up with an ecosystem architecture that would be more intuitive. The "context tags" also determined which features were more prominent and should be more accessible and higher up in the ecosystem hierarchy.</p>
                <p><b>Quantitative analysis</b> allowed us to determine which business functions tended to be grouped in which categories. Mapping the business function back to the original digital product they were from also allowed us to determine which digital products were the most "disorganised" and which were already coherent.</p>
                <p>Based on all the information we had synthesised regarding common groupings and context of use, we came up with a <b>proposal for a new ecosystem architecture</b> that would be more intuitive and be contained within lesser products.</p>
