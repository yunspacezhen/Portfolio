                        <li>We learnt buyers did not want to see their Liked listings again. There was a reason they did not transact the first time they saw it: perhaps the price was not good enough, perhaps the size was not right, perhaps the condition was too poor. Their liked listings were bookmarks for listings that came close to things they were shopping for. But they were still on the lookout for the perfect listing. </li>

                        <li>And then we concept tested these with users based on their real browsing history. And our users told us which set of recommendations was still relevant for them. With that, we built a very vivid sense of which method worked best. </li>

                        <li>There was a 5.6% increase in percentage of users with listing views, and a 10.6% increase in percentage of users with quality chats. </li>
                        <li>That means users were browsing more, and chatting more, which were healthy inputs for transactions. </li>
